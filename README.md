This is a simple song recommendation system. I have used following python libraries: numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn. Furthermore, I did all the steps like analysis, visualization, preprocessing, and system creation in Jupyter Notebook.
After creating the model, I have used streamlit to integrate the model into a web app. Finally, I used heroku to deploy the model via github.
